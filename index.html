              <p><span class="emphasize">I have worked diverse jobs in the <strong>comics</strong> and <strong>high tech</strong> industries since the 90's.</span></p>
              <p>In comics I've done everything from lettering, language localization, writing, editing, and even publishing (via <strong>Image Comics</strong>). I've written comics that have sold hundreds of thousands of issues (<em>Spawn</em> #19 and #20). I wrote and edited for the genre culture magazine <em>Tripwire</em>. I have also written articles and contributed to white papers as managing editor for <em>Multimedia Week</em> and <em>Media Device Report</em> at <strong>Jon Peddie Associates</strong>. I have even tested software and led teams localizing content for companies like <strong>Electronic Arts</strong>.</p>

                        <p>I've been writing for as long as I can remember. As a little kid my friend and I put out a hand-wrriten newspaper called the <em>Dog Daily News</em>. As an adult I wrote two issues of the comic <em>Spawn</em> that together sold almost 700,000 copies. I've also written dozens of articles and contributed to whitepapers on high tech topics like interactive TV and internet IPOs. I've also written genre articles and interviewd some great fantasy creators such as Michael Moorcock (<em>Elric</em>).</p>

                        <p>I was managing editor for two high end newsletters called <em>Multimedia Week</em> and <em>Media Device Report</em> back during the first dotcom boom. I later went on to edit the genre culture magazine <em>Tripwire</em> where I commissioned and copy-edited articles from a dozen contributers while writing some myself. I have also edited copy for startups including my own.</p>

                        <p>My consulting days are also attached to my time at <span class="emphasize"><strong>Jon Peddie Associates</strong></span> where we gathered and disseminated market and business intelligence for Fortune 100 companies like <strong>Microsoft</strong> and <strong>Intel</strong>. After leaving them I did a brief stint consulting for the likes of Ziff Davis, Fujitsu, and others.</p>

                        <p>Localizing content means taking files of raw English translations from another language and editing the content into everyday spoken English. I got my start doing this at EA/MAXIS leading teams translating and localizing <span class="emphasize"><strong>The Sims</strong></span> for various consoles. Later I took freelance work through Studio Cutie localizing manga scripts as a subcontrsactor for <strong>Dark Horse Comics.</strong> I still do this today from time to time.</p>

                        <p>It's hard to put into words the number of things I know about or can do a little bit of. I soak up information and trivia like a sponge. I am capable of learning almost any technology process given a decent lead for my learning curve. I have an underlying grok of all things tech and this framework lets me incorporate concepts that are new to me into my workflow and knowledge base at a rapid pace.</p>

                <p>There are so many things I like to do, it's ridiculous. From <strong>playing and running RPGs</strong> to <strong>AI</strong>; from <strong>following baseball</strong> to <strong>playing music</strong>; from <strong>reading about politics</strong> to <strong>watching movies and TV</strong>; from <strong>dabbling in the supernatural</strong>, to <strong>everything about comic books</strong>. <strong>Computers</strong> have always played a big part in my interests as nonted elsewhere although I can't claim them as a hobby in general (they're just tools). Frankly, I have too many hobbies but I never want for variety, maybe just for the time to do it all. But if I had to whittle them down to a list of the top things I like, they'd be:
