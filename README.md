# _PORTFOLIO_

#### _Week One Code Review Project for Epicodus_

#### By _Andy Grossberg_

## Description

_This is my PORTFOLIO page done as the final project_
_for the first week of Epicodus to demonstrate:_
_*Knowledge of GitHub_
_*Knowledge of HTML_
_*Knowledge of CSS_
_*Knowledge of Bootstrap_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Download the repository and connect to them via your browser._ *

_This project will have a little bit of CSS but nothing every browser won't render._
_Most of the files will call out to the main Bootstrap CDN location_

## Known Bugs and Issues

_Presently there are no known bugs_
_The website could benefit from more work on the psuedo-modal pop-up panels._
_They were done in CSS only and don't work on Safari or Firefox for iPhone._
_Implementing them with jQuery and/or Bootstrap's jQuery would be much better._
_This page does not play well with phones at all; bad colors and layout._
_Any future revisions will have to take that into account._
